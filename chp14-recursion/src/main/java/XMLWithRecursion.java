    Java includes more than one API for processing XML data. With the Simple API for XML (SAX), you can process an XML document one event at a time.
    Events include starting an element, getting some text from within an element, and ending an element.

    With the DOM, the API reads in an XML document, and then your code can traverse the elements in the tree of DOM elements.
    The API that fits best with recursive processing is the DOM API.
