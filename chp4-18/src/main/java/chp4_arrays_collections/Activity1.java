    /*
    Write a program that will search for multiple occurrences of a certain word in an array of strings, where each one of the objects is a single word. Use the following array, a famous quote by Frank Zappa, as a point of departure:

String[] text = {"So", "many", "books", "so", "little", "time"};

The word to search for is so. but you will have to consider that it shows up twice and that one instance is not in lowercase. As a hint, the method to compare two strings without looking at the specific casing of any of the letters in them is text1.compareToIgnoreCase(text2). To do so, perform the following steps:

    Create the text array.
    Create the variable that contains the word to be searched for: so
    Initialize the variable occurrence to -1.
    Create a for loop to iterate through the array to check for the occurrence.

    That will give the following result:

    Found query at: 0
    Found query at: 3
    Process finished with exit code 0
     */
}
