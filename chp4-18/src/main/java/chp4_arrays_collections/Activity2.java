    Iterating through Large Lists

In contemporary computing, we deal with large sets of data. The purpose of this activity is to create a random-sized list of random numbers to perform some basic operations on data, such as obtaining the average.

    To start, you should create a random list of numbers.
    To compute the average, you could create an iterator that will go through the list of values and add the weighted value corresponding to each element.
    The value coming from the iterator.next() method must be cast into a double before it can be weighed against the total number of elements.

    If you've implemented everything properly, the results of the averaging should similar to:

    Total amount of numbers: 3246
    Average: 49.785278826074396

    Or, it could be:

    Total amount of numbers: 6475
    Average: 50.3373892275651
     */


}
