public class Annotations {

    // @Override  - used to override the method of a parent class in a subclass

    // @Deprecated - used to tell developers that a particular method would soon be obsolete, i.e no longer be accepted in future use

    //@SuppressWarnings - used to suppress the warnings... e.g suppress deprecation warnings @SuppressWarnings("Deprecation")

    // avoid the use of @SuppressWarnings("all") as this could hide warnings for potential compilation errors
}
